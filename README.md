### Compatibility

Owl Carousel 2.x.x is not compatibile with previous version 1.x.x. The idea stays the same and it has a lot in common with Owl1 but the core code was re-written from scratch and Iâ€™m very proud with all the new features.

Owl Carousel has been tested in following browsers/devices:

*    Chrome
*    Firefox
